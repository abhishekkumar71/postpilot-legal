    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: Sep 23, 2025</p>

    <p>
      PostPilot ("we", "us", "our") operates the PostPilot app and website. This
      Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your
      information when you use our service.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Account information:</strong> When you sign in via Facebook, we
        may receive your name, email address and profile information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Page and Instagram data:</strong> With your permission we may
        receive Page IDs, Instagram Business Account IDs, access tokens and
        media you authorize us to post on your behalf.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Content you create:</strong> Post captions, image URLs,
        scheduled dates and related metadata.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To authenticate and authorize posting on your Facebook Pages and
        Instagram accounts.
      </li>
      <li>
        To schedule, create, publish and manage posts you request through the
        app.
      </li>
      <li>
        To improve and maintain the app, and for security and fraud prevention.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing & Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
      We will never sell your personal information. We may share data with
      service providers that help host or run the app (for example cloud hosting
      or analytics). For posting to social networks we act as an intermediary
      and use access tokens you authorize — we do not share your tokens with
      unrelated third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain data as long as your account exists or as necessary to provide
      the services. You can request deletion (see below).
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
      You can disconnect your social accounts from the app at any time; you may
      also request data deletion by emailing us (see contact below).
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable administrative and technical measures to protect your
      information. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure —
      please contact us if you suspect any issue.
    </p>
