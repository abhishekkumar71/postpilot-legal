      If you would like PostPilot to delete any personal data we hold about you,
      please follow the steps below.
    </p>

    <h2>How to request deletion</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Email us at
        <a href="mailto:marsakatlaabhishek7168@gmail.com"
          >marsakatlaabhishek7168@gmail.com</a
        >
        with the subject line: <strong>"Data Deletion Request"</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In your message, include the email address associated with your
        PostPilot account and a short description of the data you want deleted.
      </li>
      <li>
        We will respond within 7 business days with confirmation and next steps.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What we will delete</h2>
    <p>
      On verification we will delete user profile data stored by PostPilot,
      associated Page/Instagram tokens, and any scheduled posts that are
      unpublished. We will not be able to delete data stored by third-party
      platforms (Facebook, Instagram) — you must delete those from those
      services directly.
    </p>
